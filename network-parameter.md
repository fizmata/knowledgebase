Azure Network Perimeter is a logical boundary that restricts public access to PaaS resources and enforces secure communication within a defined perimeter. It supports:

### üß© Key Takeaways

- **Azure** supports FQDN filtering through Azure Firewall and allows subscription ID-based access control in Network Security Perimeter configurations.
- **AWS** uses DNS-based resolution for PrivateLink endpoints and supports IAM-based access control, including account and subscription-level restrictions.
- **Google Cloud** does not natively support FQDN filtering in VPC Service Controls but allows project and organization-level access control.
- **Perimeter 81** offers flexible FQDN filtering with wildcard support but lacks native subscription ID-based access control.
