## window sizing

`host` + `f`, to switch to full screen mode, if not yet,
`host` + `c`, to switch to/out of scaled mode,
`host` + `f`, to switch back normal size, if need,

#### Tip:

host key, default to right ctrl, the control button on right part of your keyboard,
`host` + `c` seems only work in fullscreen mode

## networking

### Bridge network
allows guest to connect like another host on the network

### Host only
connect only to the host machine and other vms if allowed

### NAT
Default one - prot forwards to selected network interface
